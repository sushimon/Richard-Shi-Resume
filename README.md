# Richard Shi's Resume

Based off of: https://github.com/sb2nov/resume

### Setup

1. Install texlive-latex-recommended

**Ubuntu**:  
`sudo apt update`  
`sudo apt install texlive-latex-recommended`

2. Fork Repo. You might want to make your fork private

3. Update `MY_NAME` to yours in `.github\workflows\build_PDFs.yml`

4. Edit all other files as needed


### Usage

Push changes to github to update PDFs. The most recent PDF will be on github for download or sharing  

**Want to tailor your resume for each role?** To do so, make a new branch for each position and push changes there. You can switch between versions easily, without having to worry about clunky naming ("firstname_lastname_resume_meta_v2-1.pdf" no longer!)  

`git checkout -b new_branch`  

Your standard resume and cover letter will remain untouched and you can access the modified resume by switching branches
